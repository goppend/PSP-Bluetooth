# PSP-Bluetooth

--- 

ℹ️ **Name Change**  This project was formerly called the `PSP-Consolizer`. The project has since been renamed to `PSP-Bluetooth` as the term `Consolizer` usually makes people think of video output which this project never worked with. 

If you wish to see the legacy `PSP-Consolizer` project it is accessible on the `legacy` branch [here](https://github.com/ste2425/PSP-Bluetooth/tree/legacy)

This project aims to add Bluetooth controller support to the PSP 1k, 2k and 3k models using an ESP32.

⚠️  **Under constuction** ⚠️
